## [ADR-0019 charter + ADR-0020 sprint 1.1] — 2026-04-17

**ADRs:** ADR-0019 (DEPA Roadmap charter), ADR-0020 (DEPA Schema Skeleton)

### Added
- `docs/ADRs/ADR-0019-depa-roadmap.md` — meta-ADR authoring the scope + sequencing of ADR-0020..0025. No code; dependency graph pins 0021+ behind 0020. Out-of-scope items (BFSI regulatory exemption engine, ABDM artefact unification) are called out as future ADRs.
- `docs/ADRs/ADR-0020-depa-schema-skeleton.md` — Sprint 1.1 plan + execution notes + test results + §11.11 verification coverage map. Architecture-doc finding logged: §11.3 and §8.4 reference a `deletion_requests` table that does not exist (ADR-0022 resolves).

### Changed
- `docs/ADRs/ADR-index.md` — ADR-0019 added as Proposed (charter, no sprints); ADR-0020 added as Completed (Phase 1 / Sprint 1.1). Reserved-range comment updated.
